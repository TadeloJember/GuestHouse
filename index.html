obelisks, tombs, castles, and Our Lady Mary of Zion church.</p>

Ethiopians are the native inhabitants of Ethiopia, as well as the global diaspora of 
Ethiopia. Ethiopians constitute several component ethnic groups, many of which are 
closely related to ethnic groups in neighboring Eritrea and other parts of the Horn of Africa.</p>

total population of the country is estimated about 112.1 million. Birr is the currency of Ethiopia.</p>

popular dishes among Ethiopians. It comes in a variety of forms, varying in type, 
size or shape of the cuts of meat used, and can range from hot to mild or contain
 little to no vegetables.</p>
 
<p>There are between 45 and 86 languages spoken in Ethiopia. Amharic is the government's
