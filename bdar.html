<h3>Bahir Dar </h3>
<p>At a distance of 550k from capital Addis Ababa, the lake and its 12 short tributaries are the
 source of the Blue Nile and with its size of about 66km long and 84km, 350,000ha, the largest
  lake of Ethiopia. At an elevation of 1,788 masl, and located in the largely Ethiopian Orthodox 
  Amhara Region, the 14m deep lake with about 45 islands - depending on the level of the lake - 8 
  of which are the home to historical monasteries and churches.</p>

<h3>Lake Tana Monasteries</h3>
<p class="p">Some <a href ="https://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/157/" target="_blank">Lake Tana monasteries</a>
 are only accessible to men; very disappointing to women.
 However, not to despair, some beautiful ones are open to all. Daily excursions are organized 
 out of Bahir Dar to two churches (Betre Maryam on the Zege peninsula and one on Dek Island) 
 where both sexes are welcome to the inner and outer ambulatories and the treasure rooms. 
 In those treasuries are many ancient manuscripts and precious pieces of religious art as well 
 as royal jewelry and other representative objects.</p>
 <p class="p"> The Lake was formed about 5 million years ago when lava blocked the about 60 streams and 
 rivers of which , Megech, Gumara, Rib Rivers and Gilgel Abbay (Little Nile River)are the 
 main tributaries. The latter, is attributed to be the source of the Blue Nile (Abbay River),
  the longest of the lakeâ€™s tributaries, as it drains Mount Amedamit, south of the lake. Over 
  the last few centuries the lake's water level  has fallen about 2m  but is now regulated with 
  a control dam where it discharges into the Blue Nile and falls over the Blue Nile Falls,
   some 40km down stream.</p>
<p class="p">Among the mammals, the Hippopotamus is the most eye-catching species, often seen in
the wetlands of the discharge into the Blue Nile River. Obviously, numerous wetland birds,
such as the great white pelican and African darter, reside at Lake Tana. It is also an
important wintering ground for many Palearctic migrant water birds. There are no crocodiles,
but the African soft-shell turtle has been recorded near the Blue Nile outflow from the lake.
There are fifteen species of mollusks, including one endemic as well as an endemic freshwater 
sponge. The Ethiopian churches are the custodians of both religious and royal treasures such 
as royal crowns, ancient bibles, historical art, sacred relics, including the remains of royals, etc.</p>
