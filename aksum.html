<h2><a href ="https://www.nationalparks-worldwide.com/eaf/ethiopia/tigray/axum.html" target="_blank">Aksum</a></h2>
<p class="p">The ruins of the ancient city of Aksum are found close to Ethiopia's northern border.
 They mark the location of the heart of ancient Ethiopia, when the 
 <a href ="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-hccc-worldcivilization/chapter/kingdom-of-aksum/"
  target="_blank">Kingdom of Aksum</a> was 
 the most powerful state between the Eastern Roman Empire and Persia. The massive ruins, 
 dating from between the 1st and the 13th century A.D., include monolithic obelisks, giant 
 stelae, royal tombs and the ruins of ancient castles. Long after its political decline in 
 the 10th century, Ethiopian emperors continued to be crowned in Aksum.</p>
 <p class="p">Situated in the highlands of northern Ethiopia, Aksum symbolizes the wealth and importance
of the civilization of the ancient Aksumite kingdom, which lasted from the 1st to the 8th 
 centuries AD. The kingdom was at the crossroads of the three continents: Africa, Arabia and 
   the Greco-Roman World, and was the most powerful state between the Eastern Roman Empire and 
Persia. In command of the ivory trade with Sudan, its fleets controlled the Red Sea trade
 through the port of Adulis and the inland routes of north eastern Africa. The ruins of the 
ancient Aksumite Civilization covered a wide area in the Tigray Plateau. The most impressive 
monuments are the monolithic obelisks, royal tombs and the palace ruins dating to the 6th and 
7th centuries AD.</p>

<p class="p">Several stelae survive in the town of Aksum dating between the 3rd and 4th centuries AD. 
The largest standing obelisk rises to a height of over 23 meters and is exquisitely carved 
to represent a nine-storey building of the Aksumites. It stands at the entrance of the main 
stelae area. The largest obelisk of some 33 meters long lies where it fell, perhaps during 
the process of erection. It is possibly the largest monolithic stele  that ancient human 
beings ever attempted to erect.</p> 
<p  class="p"> A series of inscription on stone tablets have proved to be of immense importance to 
historians of the ancient world. Some of them include trilingual text in Greek, Sabaean and
 Ge'ez (Classical Ethiopian), inscribed by King Ezana in the 4th century AD. The introduction 
 of Christianity in the 4th century AD resulted in the building of churches, such as Saint Mary 
 of Zion, rebuilt in the Gondarian period, in the 17th century AD, which is believed to hold the 
 Ark of the Covenant.</p>
 <p  class="p"> One obelisk, removed from the site and taken to Rome as a war trophy during the Italian 
 occupation, was returned to Aksum in 2005 and re-erected in in 2008. Furthermore, at the time 
 of inscription, it was noted that small, modern houses were built over most of the site,
  obscuring the majority of the underground Aksumite structures. Some of them still remain 
  covered by modern houses. In 2011, the construction of a new museum began in the main Stelae 
  Field and, unless amended, the height of the museum will have a highly negative visual impact 
  on the property. Flooding has also become a major problem in the 4th century AD Tomb of the Brick 
  Arches and other monuments. For the reasons mentioned above, the integrity of the property
   remains vulnerable.</p>&nbsp;
