<h2> Tiya Tikil Dingay</h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p class="p">Tiya Tikil Dingay is located in the Soddo Region of Ethiopia. It is best known for its 
archaeological site, a UNESCO World Heritage Site remarkable for its large stone pillars, 
many of which bear some form of decoration. The menhir or stelae, “32 of which are engraved 
with enigmatic symbols, notably swords,” mark a large, prehistoric burial complex. A German 
ethnographic expedition had visited the site in April 1935, and had found at one hour’s
 journey to the south of the caravan camp the stone monoliths with sword symbol, 
 which had been seen earlier by Neuville and Père Azaïs.The archeological site was designated 
 a World Heritage Site in 1980.</p>
 <h2> A Megalithic Stelae Field in Tiya</h2>
 <p class="p"> Ethiopia hasseveral UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including Axum (granted World Heritage 
 status in 1980), the rock–hewn churches of Lalibela (1978), the Semien Mountains National Park (1978),
the Fasiledes Castle in Gondar (1979); the prehistoric sites of Tiya (1980), the lower
 Valley of the Awash River (1980), the lower Valley of the Omo (1980), the Muslim Holy city 
of Harar (2006); and the Konso Landscape (2011). Unfortunately, the archaeology of Ethiopia 
is understudied in many ways. Little research has been done at Tiya, and there are several
difficulties in understanding these types of sites from an archaeological standpoint.
First, it is difficult to determine the identity of the megalith builders given
just the megaliths themselves. Second, archaeologists have been preoccupied with 
reconstructing ethnic histories through oral historical accounts, yet these are 
unavailable or uninformative in many cases.</p>
